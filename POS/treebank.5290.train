Behind/IN all/DT the/DT hoopla/NN is/VBZ some/DT heavy-duty/JJ competition/NN ./.
As/IN individual/JJ investors/NNS have/VBP turned/VBN away/RB from/IN the/DT stock/NN market/NN over/IN the/DT years/NNS ,/, securities/NNS firms/NNS have/VBP scrambled/VBN to/TO find/VB new/JJ products/NNS that/WDT brokers/NNS find/VBP easy/JJ to/TO sell/VB ./.

Another/DT concern/NN :/: The/DT funds/NNS '/POS share/NN prices/NNS tend/VBP to/TO swing/VB more/RBR than/IN the/DT broader/JJR market/NN ./.

The/DT reason/NN :/: Share/NN prices/NNS of/IN many/JJ of/IN these/DT funds/NNS this/DT year/NN have/VBP climbed/VBN much/RB more/RBR sharply/RB than/IN the/DT foreign/JJ stocks/NNS they/PP hold/VBP ./.

That/DT way/NN investors/NNS can/MD essentially/RB buy/VB the/DT funds/NNS without/IN paying/VBG the/DT premium/NN ./.
For/IN people/NNS who/WP insist/VBP on/RP jumping/VBG in/RB now/RB to/TO buy/VB the/DT funds/NNS ,/, Newgate/NP 's/POS Mr./NP Foot/NP says/VBZ :/: ``/`` The/DT only/JJ advice/NN I/PP have/VBP for/IN these/DT folks/NNS is/VBZ that/IN those/DT who/WP come/VBP to/TO the/DT party/NN late/RB had/VBD better/RBR be/VB ready/JJ to/TO leave/VB quickly/RB ./.

To/TO the/DT extent/NN they/PP did/VBD ,/, their/PP$ concern/NN was/VBD to/TO ensure/VB fiscal/JJ accountability/NN ./.

During/IN the/DT coming/VBG weeks/NNS ,/, President/NP Bush/NP must/MD decide/VB whether/IN to/TO veto/VB the/DT bills/NNS containing/VBG them/PP --/: or/CC ,/, alternatively/RB ,/, to/TO sign/VB these/DT bills/NNS into/IN law/NN with/IN a/DT statement/NN declaring/VBG their/PP$ intrusions/NNS on/IN executive/JJ power/NN to/TO be/VB in/IN violation/NN of/IN Article/NP II/NP ,/, and/CC thus/RB void/JJ and/CC severable/JJ ./.
The/DT 1990/CD appropriations/NNS legislation/NN attempts/VBZ to/TO strip/VB the/DT president/NN of/IN his/PP$ powers/NNS to/TO make/VB certain/JJ appointments/NNS as/IN provided/VBN by/IN Article/NP II/NP ./.
Article/NP II/NP places/VBZ on/IN the/DT president/NN the/DT duty/NN to/TO nominate/VB ,/, ``/`` and/CC by/IN and/CC with/IN the/DT Advice/NP and/CC Consent/NP of/IN the/DT Senate/NP ''/'' appoint/VB ,/, ambassadors/NNS ,/, judges/NNS ,/, and/CC other/JJ officers/NNS of/IN the/DT U.S/NP ./.

''/'' Yet/RB Section/NP 605/CD of/IN the/DT appropriations/NNS bill/NN for/IN the/DT executive/JJ office/NN provides/VBZ :/: ``/`` No/DT part/NN of/IN any/DT appropriation/NN for/IN the/DT current/JJ fiscal/JJ year/NN contained/VBN in/IN this/DT or/CC any/DT other/JJ Act/NN shall/MD be/VB paid/VBN to/TO any/DT person/NN for/IN the/DT filling/NN of/IN any/DT position/NN for/IN which/WDT he/PP or/CC she/PP has/VBZ been/VBN nominated/VBN after/IN the/DT Senate/NP has/VBZ voted/VBN not/RB to/TO approve/VB the/DT nomination/NN of/IN said/VBN person/NN ./.
''/'' Thus/RB ,/, with/IN one/CD brief/JJ passage/NN in/IN an/DT appropriations/NNS bill/NN ,/, Congress/NP repeals/VBZ the/DT president/NN 's/POS power/NN to/TO make/VB recess/NN appointments/NNS under/IN Article/NP II/NP ./.
Section/NN 605/CD also/RB imposes/VBZ unconstitutional/JJ conditions/NNS on/IN the/DT president/NN 's/POS ability/NN to/TO nominate/VB candidates/NNS of/IN his/PP$ choosing/NN ./.
The/DT language/NN of/IN the/DT appropriations/NNS rider/NN implies/VBZ that/IN any/DT nomination/NN to/TO any/DT position/NN of/IN a/DT rejected/VBN nominee/NN will/MD result/VB in/IN the/DT president/NN being/VBG denied/VBN funding/VBG to/TO pay/VB that/DT person/NN 's/POS salary/NN ./.
The/DT president/NN could/MD probably/RB not/RB avoid/VB this/DT restriction/NN by/IN choosing/VBG people/NNS willing/JJ to/TO serve/VB without/IN pay/NN ,/, because/IN the/DT Anti-Deficiency/NP Act/NP prohibits/VBZ voluntary/JJ service/NN to/TO the/DT government/NN ./.
The/DT 1990/CD appropriations/NNS bills/NNS also/RB contain/VBP a/DT number/NN of/IN ``/`` muzzling/JJ ''/'' provisions/NNS that/WDT violate/VBP the/DT recommendation/NN clause/NN in/IN Article/NP II/NP of/IN the/DT Constitution/NP ./.
Muzzling/JJ provisions/NNS ,/, which/WDT might/MD be/VB called/VBN ``/`` blindfold/NN laws/NNS ''/'' as/IN well/RB ,/, prevent/VBP the/DT executive/JJ branch/NN from/IN even/RB looking/VBG at/IN certain/JJ policy/NN options/NNS ,/, let/VB alone/RB from/IN recommending/VBG them/PP to/TO Congress/NP ./.
Such/JJ laws/NNS violate/VBP the/DT provision/NN in/IN Article/NP II/NP that/WDT requires/VBZ the/DT president/NN to/TO make/VB recommendations/NNS to/TO Congress/NP ,/, but/CC which/WDT gives/VBZ the/DT president/NN the/DT discretion/NN to/TO select/VB the/DT subject/JJ matter/NN of/IN those/DT recommendations/NNS ./.
Typically/RB ,/, these/DT laws/NNS seek/VBP to/TO prevent/VB executive/JJ branch/NN officials/NNS from/IN inquiring/VBG into/IN whether/IN certain/JJ federal/JJ programs/NNS make/VBP any/DT economic/JJ sense/NN or/CC proposing/VBG more/JJR market-oriented/JJ alternatives/NNS to/TO regulations/NNS ./.
Probably/RB the/DT most/RBS egregious/JJ example/NN is/VBZ a/DT proviso/NN in/IN the/DT appropriations/NNS bill/NN for/IN the/DT executive/NN office/NN that/WDT prevents/VBZ the/DT president/NN 's/POS Office/NP of/IN Management/NP and/CC Budget/NP from/IN subjecting/VBG agricultural/JJ marketing/NN orders/NNS to/TO any/DT cost-benefit/JJ scrutiny/NN ./.

The/DT United/NP Kingdom/NP High/NP Court/NP declared/VBD illegal/JJ a/DT variety/NN of/IN interest-rate/NN swap/NN transactions/NNS and/CC options/NNS deals/NNS between/IN a/DT London/NP borough/NN council/NN and/CC commercial/JJ banks/NNS ./.
The/DT ruling/NN could/MD lead/VB to/TO the/DT cancellation/NN of/IN huge/JJ bank/NN debts/NNS the/DT London/NP Borough/NP of/IN Hammersmith/NP and/CC Fulham/NP ran/VBD up/IN after/IN losing/VBG heavily/RB on/IN swap/NN transactions/NNS ./.
As/RB many/JJ as/IN 70/CD U.K./NP and/CC international/JJ banks/NNS stand/VBP to/TO lose/VB several/JJ hundred/CD million/CD pounds/NNS should/MD the/DT decision/NN be/VB upheld/VBN and/CC set/VB a/DT precedent/NN for/IN other/JJ municipalities/NNS ./.
An/DT appeal/NN is/VBZ expected/VBN ./.
In/IN response/NN to/TO the/DT ruling/NN ,/, gilt/JJ futures/NNS swiftly/RB plunged/VBD more/JJR than/IN a/DT point/NN yesterday/NN before/IN recovering/VBG much/JJ of/IN the/DT loss/NN by/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT session/NN ./.
Gilts/NNS ,/, or/CC British/JJ government/NN bonds/NNS ,/, which/WDT also/RB fell/VBD sharply/RB initially/RB ,/, retraced/VBD some/DT of/IN the/DT losses/NNS to/TO end/VB about/IN 3\/8/CD point/NN lower/JJR ./.
The/DT council/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ alleged/VBN to/TO have/VB engaged/VBN in/IN over/IN 600/CD deals/NNS valued/VBN at/IN over/IN #/# 6/CD billion/CD (/( $/$ 9.5/CD billion/CD )/) ,/, lost/VBD millions/NNS of/IN pounds/NNS from/IN soured/JJ swap/NN deals/NNS ./.
At/IN one/CD point/NN ,/, Hammersmith/NP is/VBZ reported/VBN to/TO have/VB accounted/VBN for/IN as/RB much/JJ as/IN 10/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT sterling/NN market/NN in/IN interest-rate/NN swap/NN dealings/NNS ./.
When/WRB two/CD parties/NNS engage/VBP in/IN an/DT interest-rate/NN swap/NN ,/, they/PP are/VBP betting/VBG against/IN each/DT other/JJ on/IN future/JJ rates/NNS ./.
Thus/RB ,/, an/DT institution/NN obligated/VBD to/TO make/VB fixed-rate/JJ interest/NN payments/NNS on/IN debt/NN swaps/NNS the/DT payments/NNS with/IN another/DT making/VBG floating-rate/JJ payments/NNS ./.
In/IN most/JJS of/IN the/DT British/JJ transactions/NNS ,/, the/DT municipalities/NNS agreed/VBD to/TO make/VB floating-rate/JJ payments/NNS to/TO banks/NNS ,/, which/WDT would/MD make/VB fixed-rate/JJ payments/NNS ./.
As/IN interest/NN rates/NNS rose/VBD ,/, municipalities/NNS owed/VBD the/DT banks/NNS more/JJR than/IN the/DT banks/NNS were/VBD paying/VBG them/PP ./.
The/DT court/NN hearing/NN began/VBD in/IN early/JJ October/NP at/IN the/DT request/NN of/IN Anthony/NP Hazell/NP ,/, district/NN auditor/NN for/IN Hammersmith/NP ,/, who/WP argued/VBD that/IN local/JJ councils/NNS are/VBP n't/RB vested/VBN with/IN constitutional/JJ authority/NN to/TO engage/VB in/IN such/JJ capital-markets/JJ activities/NNS ./.
The/DT council/NN backed/VBD the/DT audit/NN commission/NN 's/POS stand/NN that/IN the/DT swap/NN transactions/NNS are/VBP illegal/JJ ./.
Although/IN the/DT Hammersmith/NP and/CC Fulham/NP council/NN was/VBD by/IN far/RB the/DT most/RBS active/JJ local/JJ authority/NN engaging/VBG in/IN such/JJ capital-markets/JJ transactions/NNS ,/, the/DT court/NN decision/NN could/MD set/VB a/DT precedent/NN for/IN similar/JJ transactions/NNS by/IN 77/CD other/JJ local/JJ councils/NNS ./.
``/`` While/IN this/DT court/NN ruling/NN was/VBD only/RB on/IN Hammersmith/NP ,/, it/PP will/MD obviously/RB be/VB very/RB persuasive/JJ in/IN other/JJ cases/NNS of/IN a/DT similar/JJ nature/NN ,/, ''/'' a/DT solicitor/NN representing/VBG one/CD of/IN the/DT banks/NNS said/VBD ./.
Already/RB ,/, 10/CD local/JJ councils/NNS have/VBP refused/VBN to/TO honor/VB fees/NNS and/CC payments/NNS to/TO banks/NNS incurred/VBN during/IN various/JJ swaps/NNS dealings/NNS ./.

If/IN the/DT banks/NNS exhaust/VBP all/DT avenues/NNS of/IN appeal/NN ,/, it/PP is/VBZ possible/JJ that/IN they/PP would/MD seek/VB to/TO have/VB the/DT illegality/NN ruling/NN work/VB both/DT ways/NNS ,/, some/DT market/NN sources/NNS said/VBD ./.

Too/RB often/RB now/RB ,/, a/DT single/JJ court/NN decision/NN becomes/VBZ the/DT precedent/NN for/IN other/JJ ,/, less/RBR compelling/JJ cases/NNS ./.

But/CC as/IN Duke/NP University/NP law/NN professor/NN William/NP Van/NP Alstyne/NP notes/VBZ ,/, by/IN this/DT reasoning/NN a/DT defendant/NN could/MD be/VB held/VBN liable/JJ in/IN New/NP York/NP for/IN a/DT bad/JJ apple/NN even/RB if/IN he/PP sold/VBD all/PDT his/PP$ apples/NNS in/IN California/NP ./.

Mips/NP Computer/NP Systems/NPS Inc./NP today/NN will/MD unveil/VB a/DT new/JJ general-purpose/JJ computer/NN that/WDT will/MD compete/VB with/IN more/RBR expensive/JJ machines/NNS from/IN companies/NNS such/JJ as/IN Sun/NP Microsystems/NPS Inc./NP and/CC Digital/NP Equipment/NP Corp/NP ./.
The/DT closely/RB held/JJ Sunnyvale/NP ,/, Calif./NP ,/, company/NN also/RB will/MD announce/VB an/DT agreement/NN to/TO supply/VB computers/NNS to/TO Control/NP Data/NP Corp./NP ,/, which/WDT will/MD sell/VB Mips/NP machines/NNS under/IN its/PP$ own/JJ label/NN ./.
The/DT new/JJ Mips/NP machine/NN ,/, called/VBN the/DT RC6280/NN ,/, will/MD cost/VB $/$ 150,000/CD for/IN a/DT basic/JJ system/NN ./.
The/DT computer/NN processes/VBZ 55/CD million/CD instructions/NNS per/IN second/NN and/CC uses/VBZ only/RB one/CD central/JJ processing/VBG chip/NN ,/, unlike/IN many/JJ rival/JJ machines/NNS using/VBG several/JJ processors/NNS ./.
The/DT machine/NN employs/VBZ reduced/JJ instruction-set/JJ computing/NN ,/, or/CC RISC/NP ,/, technology/NN ./.
At/IN that/DT price/NN ,/, an/DT analyst/NN familiar/JJ with/IN the/DT machine/NN said/VBD ,/, the/DT computer/NN offers/VBZ up/IN to/TO 10/CD times/NNS the/DT performance/NN of/IN similar/JJ machines/NNS ./.
``/`` In/IN the/DT price/NN range/NN it/PP 's/VBZ a/DT tremendously/RB high-performing/JJ product/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Sandy/NP Gant/NP ,/, an/DT analyst/NN at/IN the/DT market-research/JJ firm/NN InfoCorp/NP ./.
The/DT machine/NN is/VBZ part/NN of/IN an/DT effort/NN by/IN Mips/NP to/TO establish/VB itself/PP as/IN a/DT supplier/NN of/IN computers/NNS ,/, not/RB just/RB of/IN integrated-circuit/JJ technology/NN ./.
Mips/NP also/RB wants/VBZ to/TO wedge/VB into/IN markets/NNS other/JJ than/IN traditional/JJ RISC/NP applications/NNS such/JJ as/IN engineering/NN ;/: Mips/NP said/VBD the/DT new/JJ machine/NN will/MD also/RB be/VB used/VBN by/IN businesses/NNS and/CC for/IN communications/NNS ./.
``/`` This/DT clearly/RB demonstrates/VBZ that/IN Mips/NP is/VBZ a/DT systems/NNS company/NN rather/RB than/IN just/RB a/DT chip/NN company/NN ,/, ''/'' said/VBD Mips/NP Vice/NP President/NP John/NP Hime/NP ./.
The/DT Control/NP Data/NP deal/NN is/VBZ a/DT boon/NN for/IN Mips/NP because/IN it/PP gives/VBZ the/DT the/DT five-year-old/JJ company/NN one/CD more/JJR ally/NN as/IN it/PP battles/VBZ more/RBR established/JJ electronic/JJ concerns/NNS such/JJ as/IN Sun/NP ,/, Hewlett-Packard/NP Co./NP ,/, Motorola/NP Inc./NP and/CC Intel/NP Corp./NP for/IN the/DT emerging/VBG market/NN for/IN RISC/NP machines/NNS ./.
RISC/NP technology/NN speeds/VBZ up/RP a/DT computer/NN by/IN simplifying/VBG the/DT internal/JJ software/NN ./.
For/IN Mips/NP ,/, which/WDT expects/VBZ revenue/NN of/IN $/$ 100/CD million/CD this/DT year/NN ,/, big-name/JJ allies/NNS such/JJ as/IN Control/NP Data/NP are/VBP essential/JJ to/TO attract/VB software/NN developers/NNS to/TO the/DT company/NN 's/POS RISC/NP architecture/NN ./.

Today/NN 's/POS agreement/NN gives/VBZ Control/NP Data/NP a/DT machine/NN to/TO compete/VB against/IN Digital/NP and/CC other/JJ general-purpose/JJ computer/NN makers/NNS ,/, said/VBD John/NP Logan/NP ,/, a/DT computer-market/JJ analyst/NN at/IN Aberdeen/NP Group/NP Inc./NP of/IN Boston/NP ./.

Mips/NP will/MD start/VB shipping/VBG its/PP$ new/JJ machine/NN in/IN the/DT first/JJ quarter/NN of/IN 1990/CD ,/, he/PP said/VBD ./.
The/DT machine/NN uses/VBZ a/DT single/JJ processor/NN ,/, which/WDT makes/VBZ it/PP easier/JJR to/TO program/VB than/IN competing/VBG machines/NNS using/VBG several/JJ processors/NNS ./.

``/`` Last/JJ year/NN ,/, there/EX were/VBD only/RB several/JJ big/JJ investors/NNS who/WP were/VBD interested/JJ ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ Kinji/NP Kato/NP ,/, a/DT vice/NN president/NN at/IN the/DT international/JJ arm/NN of/IN Nomura/NP Securities/NPS Co/NP ./.
``/`` This/DT year/NN ,/, some/DT investors/NNS are/VBP changing/VBG their/PP$ policies/NNS and/CC investing/VBG a/DT lot/NN ./.
''/'' Ultimately/RB ,/, he/PP says/VBZ ,/, strong/JJ demand/NN could/MD help/VB to/TO drive/VB down/RP interest/NN rates/NNS on/IN mortgage/NN securities/NNS ./.
At/IN the/DT moment/NN ,/, Nomura/NP is/VBZ the/DT only/JJ Japanese/JJ institution/NN authorized/VBN to/TO act/VB as/IN a/DT primary/JJ seller/NN of/IN Fannie/NP Mae/NP instruments/NNS ./.
But/CC other/JJ Japanese/JJ institutions/NNS say/VBP privately/RB that/IN they/PP are/VBP considering/VBG asking/VBG to/TO join/VB the/DT 59-dealer/JJ selling/VBG group/NN ./.
These/DT securities/NNS are/VBP attractive/JJ to/TO Japanese/JJ investors/NNS for/IN three/CD reasons/NNS ./.
First/LS ,/, they/PP are/VBP safe/JJ ./.
While/IN they/PP are/VBP n't/RB backed/VBN by/IN the/DT full/JJ faith/NN and/CC credit/NN of/IN the/DT U.S./NP government/NN ,/, as/IN Treasury/NP bonds/NNS are/VBP ,/, it/PP is/VBZ widely/RB assumed/VBN that/IN the/DT government/NN would/MD support/VB them/PP if/IN necessary/JJ ./.
(/( U.S./NP Treasury/NP bonds/NNS are/VBP still/RB the/DT dollar-denominated/JJ investment/NN of/IN choice/NN for/IN long-term/JJ Japanese/JJ investors/NNS )/) ./.
Second/LS ,/, they/PP are/VBP liquid/JJ ./.
The/DT secondary/JJ market/NN in/IN federally/RB backed/JJ mortgage/NN securities/NNS now/RB exceeds/VBZ $/$ 900/CD billion/CD ,/, or/CC nearly/RB half/NN of/IN the/DT $/$ 2.2/CD trillion/CD in/IN U.S./NP residential/JJ mortgages/NNS issued/VBN ./.
Third/LS ,/, they/PP offer/VBP high/JJ yields/NNS ./.
At/IN the/DT moment/NN ,/, some/DT offer/VBP as/RB much/JJ as/IN 1.6/CD to/TO 1.8/CD percentage/NN points/NNS over/IN Treasury/NP securities/NNS of/IN similar/JJ maturities/NNS ./.
But/CC there/EX is/VBZ a/DT risk/NN ,/, which/WDT the/DT Japanese/NPS discovered/VBD when/WRB they/PP first/RB dipped/VBD their/PP$ toes/NNS into/IN the/DT market/NN nearly/RB five/CD years/NNS ago/RB ./.
Since/IN most/JJS mortgages/NNS can/MD be/VB prepaid/VBN or/CC refinanced/VBN at/IN any/DT time/NN ,/, issuers/NNS of/IN mortgage/NN securities/NNS retain/VBP the/DT right/NN to/TO buy/VB back/RB their/PP$ bonds/NNS before/IN maturity/NN ./.
That/DT 's/VBZ a/DT headache/NN for/IN long-term/JJ investors/NNS ,/, since/IN it/PP forces/VBZ them/PP to/TO reinvest/VB their/PP$ money/NN --/: usually/RB at/IN lower/JJR rates/NNS than/IN the/DT original/JJ mortgage/NN securities/NNS carried/VBD ./.
``/`` Two/CD or/CC three/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, the/DT problem/NN was/VBD that/IN people/NNS did/VBD n't/RB understand/VB the/DT prepayment/NN risk/NN ,/, ''/'' says/VBZ Nomura/NN 's/POS Mr./NP Kato/NP ./.
``/`` So/RB they/PP were/VBD surprised/JJ and/CC very/RB disappointed/JJ by/IN prepayment/NN ./.
''/'' Compounding/VBG the/DT trouble/NN to/TO Japanese/JJ investors/NNS ,/, mortgage/NN securities/NNS pay/VBP interest/NN monthly/RB ,/, since/IN most/JJS mortgages/NNS require/VBP homeowners/NNS to/TO make/VB monthly/JJ payments/NNS ./.
But/CC Japanese/JJ institutional/JJ investors/NNS are/VBP used/VBN to/TO quarterly/JJ or/CC semiannual/JJ payments/NNS on/IN their/PP$ investments/NNS ,/, so/IN the/DT monthly/JJ cash/NN flow/NN posed/VBD administrative/JJ problems/NNS ./.
As/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, Japanese/JJ investors/NNS steered/VBD clear/RB of/IN the/DT mortgage/NN securities/NNS ./.
But/CC they/PP did/VBD n't/RB lose/VB touch/NN with/IN the/DT U.S./NP issuers/NNS ./.
Since/IN 1985/CD ,/, Japanese/JJ investors/NNS have/VBP bought/VBN nearly/RB 80/CD %/NN of/IN $/$ 10/CD billion/CD in/IN Fannie/NP Mae/NP corporate/JJ debt/NN issued/VBN to/TO foreigners/NNS ,/, money/NN that/IN Fannie/NP Mae/NP uses/VBZ to/TO buy/VB mortgages/NNS from/IN U.S./NP banks/NNS ./.
And/CC Japanese/JJ investors/NNS took/VBD up/RB nearly/RB all/DT of/IN two/CD $/$ 200/CD million/CD Real/JJ Estate/NP Mortgage/NP Investment/NP Conduits/NNS ,/, a/DT kind/NN of/IN collateralized/JJ mortgage/NN obligation/NN ,/, that/WDT were/VBD offered/VBN to/TO foreigners/NNS this/DT year/NN ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, further/JJ packaging/NN of/IN mortgage-backed/JJ securities/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN Blackstone/VBP 's/POS fund/NN ,/, have/VB reduced/VBN the/DT effects/NNS of/IN prepayment/NN risk/NN and/CC automatically/RB reinvest/VB monthly/JJ payments/NNS so/IN institutions/NNS do/VBP n't/RB have/VB to/TO ./.
Freddie/NP Mac/NP for/IN years/NNS has/VBZ offered/VBN a/DT so-called/JJ participation/NN certificate/NN that/WDT guarantees/VBZ it/PP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB prepaid/VBN for/IN a/DT set/NN number/NN of/IN years/NNS and/CC offers/VBZ semiannual/JJ payments/NNS ./.
As/IN Georgia-Pacific/NP 's/POS bid/NN for/IN Great/NP Northern/NP Nekoosa/NP has/VBZ shown/VBN ,/, uninvited/JJ takeovers/NNS are/VBP still/RB alive/JJ despite/IN premature/JJ reports/NNS of/IN their/PP$ demise/NN ./.
Therefore/RB ,/, the/DT debate/NN about/IN poison/NN pills/NNS will/MD continue/VB to/TO rage/VB in/IN the/DT boardrooms/NNS of/IN corporations/NNS and/CC the/DT halls/NNS of/IN academia/NN ./.
Although/IN poison/NN pills/NNS come/VBP in/IN different/JJ colors/NNS and/CC shapes/NNS ,/, they/PP usually/RB give/VBP current/JJ shareholders/NNS the/DT right/NN to/TO buy/VB more/JJR stock/NN of/IN their/PP$ corporation/NN at/IN a/DT large/JJ discount/NN if/IN certain/JJ events/NNS occur/VBP --/: typically/RB ,/, if/IN a/DT hostile/JJ bidder/NN acquires/VBZ more/JJR than/IN a/DT specified/JJ percentage/NN of/IN the/DT corporation/NN 's/POS stock/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, these/DT discount/NN purchase/NN rights/NNS may/MD generally/RB be/VB redeemed/VBN at/IN a/DT nominal/JJ cost/NN by/IN the/DT corporation/NN 's/POS directors/NNS if/IN they/PP approve/VBP of/IN a/DT bidder/NN ./.
Supporters/NNS of/IN poison/NN pills/NNS argue/VBP that/DT their/PP$ adoption/NN forces/VBZ bidders/NNS to/TO negotiate/VB with/IN a/DT corporation/NN 's/POS directors/NNS ,/, who/WP are/VBP thereby/RB put/VBN in/IN a/DT better/JJR position/NN to/TO pursue/VB the/DT long-term/JJ interests/NNS of/IN the/DT corporation/NN ./.
Recent/JJ studies/NNS by/IN Georgeson/NP &/CC Co./NP conclude/VBP that/IN corporations/NNS with/IN poison/NN pills/NNS have/VBP experienced/VBN greater/JJR stock-price/JJ appreciation/NN than/IN corporations/NNS without/IN poison/NN pills/NNS during/IN the/DT past/JJ few/JJ years/NNS ./.
Critics/NNS of/IN poison/NN pills/NNS argue/VBP that/IN they/PP harm/VBP shareholders/NNS by/IN letting/VBG corporate/JJ management/NN defeat/VB takeover/NN bids/NNS at/IN premium/JJ prices/NNS and/CC by/IN deterring/VBG premium/JJ bids/NNS from/IN ever/RB being/VBG made/VBN to/TO shareholders/NNS ./.
These/DT critics/NNS are/VBP backed/VBN by/IN several/JJ academic/JJ studies/NNS showing/VBG that/IN the/DT adoption/NN of/IN poison/NN pills/NNS reduces/VBZ shareholder/NN values/NNS not/RB merely/RB in/IN the/DT short/JJ run/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB over/IN longer/JJR periods/NNS ./.
Institutional/JJ investors/NNS that/WDT must/MD evaluate/VB poison/NN pills/NNS on/IN a/DT regular/JJ basis/NN are/VBP interested/JJ less/RBR in/IN this/DT general/JJ debate/NN than/IN in/IN the/DT answers/NNS to/TO specific/JJ questions/NNS about/IN the/DT corporation/NN issuing/VBG the/DT pill/NN ./.
Does/VBZ this/DT corporation/NN have/VB a/DT high-quality/JJ management/NN team/NN with/IN a/DT good/JJ track/NN record/NN ?/.
Does/VBZ this/DT team/NN have/VB a/DT viable/JJ strategy/NN for/IN improving/VBG shareholder/NN values/NNS ,/, and/CC does/VBZ this/DT strategy/NN require/VB implementation/NN over/IN an/DT extended/JJ period/NN ?/.
Will/MD the/DT adoption/NN of/IN this/DT particular/JJ form/NN of/IN a/DT poison/NN pill/NN significantly/RB improve/VB the/DT chances/NNS for/IN management/NN to/TO carry/VB out/RP this/DT strategy/NN ?/.
If/IN the/DT answers/NNS to/TO these/DT questions/NNS are/VBP affirmative/JJ ,/, then/RB institutional/JJ investors/NNS are/VBP likely/JJ to/TO be/VB favorably/RB disposed/JJ toward/IN a/DT specific/JJ poison/NN pill/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT problem/NN is/VBZ that/DT once/RB most/JJS poison/JJ pills/NNS are/VBP adopted/VBN ,/, they/PP survive/VBP forever/RB ./.
Although/IN the/DT current/JJ management/NN team/NN may/MD be/VB outstanding/JJ ,/, who/WP will/MD be/VB the/DT CEO/NP in/IN 10/CD years/NNS ?/.
Although/IN the/DT five-year/JJ strategy/NN may/MD be/VB excellent/JJ ,/, what/WP will/MD be/VB the/DT strategy/NN in/IN 25/CD years/NNS ?/.
The/DT solution/NN to/TO this/DT problem/NN is/VBZ a/DT time-limited/JJ poison/NN pill/NN ./.
The/DT limit/NN could/MD range/VB from/IN three/CD years/NNS to/TO seven/CD years/NNS ,/, depending/VBG on/IN the/DT composition/NN of/IN the/DT management/NN team/NN and/CC the/DT nature/NN of/IN its/PP$ strategic/JJ plan/NN ./.
At/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN this/DT period/NN ,/, the/DT poison/NN pill/NN would/MD be/VB eliminated/VBN automatically/RB ,/, unless/IN a/DT new/JJ poison/NN pill/NN were/VBD approved/VBN by/IN the/DT then-current/JJ shareholders/NNS ,/, who/WP would/MD have/VB an/DT opportunity/NN to/TO evaluate/VB the/DT corporation/NN 's/POS strategy/NN and/CC management/NN team/NN at/IN that/DT time/NN ./.
One/CD rare/JJ example/NN of/IN a/DT time-limited/JJ poison/NN pill/NN is/VBZ the/DT shareholder/NN rights/NNS plan/NN adopted/VBN by/IN Pennzoil/NP last/JJ year/NN after/IN it/PP received/VBD a/DT huge/JJ litigation/NN settlement/NN from/IN Texaco/NP ./.
Pennzoil/NP 's/POS poison/NN pill/NN covers/VBZ five/CD years/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO give/VB current/JJ management/NN enough/JJ time/NN to/TO put/VB these/DT proceeds/NNS to/TO work/VB in/IN a/DT prudent/JJ manner/NN ./.
Another/DT interesting/JJ example/NN is/VBZ the/DT poison/NN pill/NN adopted/VBN recently/RB by/IN Pittsburgh-based/JJ National/NP Intergroup/NP Inc./NP ,/, a/DT diversified/JJ holding/VBG company/NN ./.
The/DT State/NP of/IN Wisconsin/NP Investment/NP Board/NP ,/, which/WDT owned/VBD about/IN 7/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT company/NN 's/POS voting/NN stock/NN ,/, worked/VBD with/IN management/NN to/TO devise/VB a/DT time-limited/JJ poison/NN pill/NN ./.
This/DT pill/NN automatically/RB expires/VBZ after/IN three/CD years/NNS unless/IN continued/VBN by/IN a/DT vote/NN of/IN the/DT shareholders/NNS ./.
The/DT attitude/NN of/IN the/DT Wisconsin/NP Investment/NP Board/NP reflects/VBZ a/DT growing/VBG receptivity/NN to/TO time-limited/JJ poison/NN pills/NNS on/IN the/DT part/NN of/IN institutional/JJ investors/NNS ,/, as/IN shown/VBN by/IN the/DT discussions/NNS at/IN recent/JJ meetings/NNS of/IN the/DT Council/NP of/IN Institutional/NP Investors/NPS and/CC my/PP$ informal/JJ survey/NN of/IN several/JJ retirement/NN plans/NNS with/IN large/JJ stock/NN positions/NNS ./.

Nissan/NP 's/POS market/NN share/NN in/IN Japan/NP had/VBD been/VBN dropping/VBG year/NN by/IN year/NN since/IN the/DT beginning/NN of/IN the/DT decade/NN ./.
Its/PP$ U.S./NP sales/NNS sagged/VBD ,/, partly/RB because/IN of/IN price/NN increases/NNS due/JJ to/TO the/DT rising/VBG yen/NNS ./.
Worst/RBS of/IN all/DT ,/, Nissan/NP was/VBD preoccupied/VBN with/IN management/NN infighting/NN ,/, cronyism/NN and/CC corporate/JJ rigidity/NN ./.
Consider/VB the/DT experience/NN of/IN Satoko/NP Kitada/NP ,/, a/DT 30-year-old/JJ designer/NN of/IN vehicle/NN interiors/NNS who/WP joined/VBD Nissan/NP in/IN 1982/CD ./.

''/'' This/DT system/NN produced/VBD boring/JJ ,/, boxy/JJ cars/NNS that/IN consumers/NNS just/RB were/VBD n't/RB buying/VBG ./.
Desperately/RB hoping/VBG to/TO spark/VB sales/NNS ,/, Nissan/NP transferred/VBD 5,000/CD middle/JJ managers/NNS and/CC plant/NN workers/NNS to/TO dealerships/NNS ./.

One/CD group/NN of/IN middle-aged/JJ manufacturing/VBG men/NNS from/IN the/DT company/NN 's/POS Zama/NP plant/NN outside/IN Tokyo/NP was/VBD supposed/VBN to/TO check/VB out/RP a/DT trendy/JJ restaurant/NN in/IN the/DT city/NN ./.

Later/RB ,/, Nissan/NP borrowed/VBD other/JJ Honda/NP practices/NNS ,/, including/VBG an/DT engineering/NN ``/`` idea/NN contest/NN ''/'' to/TO promote/VB inventiveness/NN ./.
One/CD engineer/NN developed/VBD a/DT ``/`` crab/NN car/NN ''/'' that/WDT moves/VBZ sideways/RB ./.

Despite/IN the/DT pain/NN of/IN adjusting/NN ,/, the/DT cultural/JJ revolution/NN has/VBZ begun/VBN to/TO yield/VB exciting/JJ cars/NNS ./.
A/DT year/NN ago/RB ,/, the/DT company/NN completely/RB revamped/VBD its/PP$ near-luxury/JJ sedan/NN ,/, the/DT $/$ 17,699/CD Maxima/NP ,/, which/WDT competes/VBZ against/IN a/DT broad/JJ range/NN of/IN upscale/NN sedans/NNS ;/: it/PP replaced/VBD its/PP$ boxy/JJ ,/, pug-nosed/JJ body/NN with/IN sleek/JJ ,/, aerodynamic/JJ lines/NNS ./.
Since/IN then/RB ,/, Nissan/NN also/RB has/VBZ launched/VBN new/JJ versions/NNS of/IN the/DT $/$ 13,249/CD 240SX/NP sporty/JJ coupe/NN and/CC 300ZX/NP sports/NNS car/NN ./.
The/DT restyled/JJ 300ZX/NP costs/VBZ as/RB much/JJ as/IN $/$ 33,000/CD and/CC is/VBZ squared/VBN off/RB against/IN the/DT Porche/NP 944/CD ,/, which/WDT begins/VBZ at/IN $/$ 41,900/CD ./.
Besides/IN new/JJ styling/NN ,/, the/DT new/JJ Nissans/NPS have/VBP more/RBR powerful/JJ engines/NNS and/CC more/RBR sophisticated/JJ suspension/NN systems/NNS ./.
All/DT three/CD new/JJ models/NNS are/VBP outselling/VBG their/PP$ predecessors/NNS by/IN wide/JJ margins/NNS ./.
In/IN its/PP$ home/NN market/NN ,/, Nissan/NP has/VBZ grabbed/VBN attention/NN with/IN limited-production/JJ minicars/NNS featuring/VBG styling/VBG odd/JJ enough/RB to/TO be/VB cute/JJ ./.

Nissan/NP initially/RB planned/VBD to/TO sell/VB just/RB 10,000/CD Paos/NPS ,/, but/CC sales/NNS have/VBP passed/VBN 50,000/CD ,/, and/CC there/EX 's/VBZ a/DT one-year/JJ waiting/NN list/NN for/IN the/DT car/NN ./.
Then/RB ,/, there/EX 's/VBZ the/DT S-Cargo/NP ,/, an/DT offbeat/JJ delivery/NN van/NN with/IN a/DT snail-like/JJ body/NN that/WDT inspired/VBD its/PP$ name/NN ./.
Nissan/NP helped/VBD develop/VB a/DT Tokyo/NP restaurant/NN with/IN both/DT vehicles/NNS as/IN its/PP$ design/NN theme/NN ./.
The/DT chairs/NNS are/VBP S-Cargo/NP seats/NNS ,/, and/CC a/DT gift/NN shop/NN sells/VBZ such/JJ items/NNS as/IN alarm/NN clocks/NNS styled/VBN like/IN the/DT Pao/NP 's/POS oversized/JJ speedometer/NN ./.
All/PDT these/DT vehicles/NNS have/VBP sharply/RB improved/VBN Nissan/NP 's/POS morale/NN and/CC image/NN --/: but/CC have/VBP n't/RB done/VBN much/RB for/IN its/PP$ market/NN share/NN ./.
Nissan/NP had/VBD 29/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT Japanese/JJ car/NN market/NN in/IN 1980/CD before/IN beginning/VBG a/DT depressing/JJ eight-year/JJ slide/NN that/WDT continued/VBD through/IN last/JJ year/NN ./.
Strong/JJ sales/NNS so/RB far/RB this/DT year/NN are/VBP certain/JJ to/TO turn/VB the/DT tide/NN ,/, but/CC even/RB the/DT 25/CD %/NN market/NN share/NN that/IN Nissan/NP expects/VBZ in/IN 1989/CD will/MD leave/VB it/PP far/RB below/IN its/PP$ position/NN at/IN the/DT beginning/NN of/IN the/DT decade/NN ./.
Nissan/NP concedes/VBZ that/IN it/PP wo/MD n't/RB recoup/VB all/DT its/PP$ market-share/NN losses/NNS in/IN Japan/NP until/IN at/IN least/JJS 1995/CD ,/, and/CC even/RB that/DT timetable/NN might/MD prove/VB optimistic/JJ ./.
``/`` Everyone/NN else/JJ is/VBZ going/VBG to/TO catch/VB up/RB ''/'' with/IN Nissan/NP 's/POS innovative/JJ designs/NNS ,/, says/VBZ A./NN Rama/NP Krishna/NP ,/, auto/NN analyst/NN at/IN First/JJ Boston/NP (/( Japan/NP )/) Ltd/NP ./.
Nissan/NP 's/POS pace/NN of/IN new-model/JJ hits/NNS will/MD slow/VB ,/, he/PP adds/VBZ ,/, just/RB as/IN arch-rival/JJ Toyota/NP unleashes/VBZ its/PP$ own/JJ batch/NN of/IN new/JJ cars/NNS ./.
Likewise/RB ,/, in/IN the/DT U.S./NP ,/, Nissan/NP has/VBZ grabbed/VBN 5.2/CD %/NN of/IN the/DT car/NN market/NN so/RB far/RB this/DT year/NN ,/, up/RB from/IN 4.5/CD %/NN a/DT year/NN ago/RB ./.
But/CC even/RB that/WDT brings/VBZ Nissan/NP only/RB to/TO the/DT share/NN it/PP had/VBD in/IN 1987/CD ,/, and/CC leaves/VBZ the/DT company/NN behind/IN its/PP$ high/NN of/IN 5.5/CD %/NN in/IN 1980/CD and/CC 1982/CD ./.
Why/WRB ?/.
So/RB far/RB ,/, Nissan/NP 's/POS new-model/NN successes/NNS are/VBP mostly/RB specialized/JJ vehicles/NNS with/IN limited/JJ sales/NNS potential/NN ./.
In/IN compact/NN and/CC subcompact/NN cars/NNS ,/, the/DT bread-and-butter/JJ sales/NNS generators/NNS for/IN Japanese/JJ auto/NN makers/NNS ,/, Nissan/NP still/RB trails/VBZ Toyota/NP and/CC Honda/NP ./.
Nissan/NP hopes/VBZ that/IN that/DT will/MD start/VB to/TO change/VB this/DT fall/NN ,/, with/IN its/PP$ new/JJ version/NN of/IN the/DT Stanza/NP compact/JJ sedan/NN ./.
The/DT Stanza/NP has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT nonentity/NN compared/VBN with/IN Honda/NP 's/POS hugely/RB successful/JJ Accord/NP and/CC Toyota/NP 's/POS Camry/NP ./.
But/CC this/DT year/NN ,/, Honda/NP has/VBZ revamped/VBN the/DT Accord/NP and/CC made/VBD it/PP a/DT midsized/JJ car/NN ./.
Nissan/NP instead/RB has/VBZ kept/VBN its/PP$ new/JJ Stanza/NP a/DT bit/RB smaller/JJR than/IN that/DT and/CC cut/VBN the/DT base/JJ price/NN 6/CD %/NN ;/: at/IN $/$ 11,450/CD ,/, Stanza/NP prices/NNS start/VBP $/$ 749/CD below/IN the/DT predecessor/NN model/NN yet/RB have/VBP a/DT more-powerful/JJR engine/NN ./.
Accord/NP prices/NNS start/VBP at/IN $/$ 12,345/CD ./.
Nissan/NP 's/POS risk/NN is/VBZ that/IN its/PP$ low-base-price/JJ strategy/NN might/MD get/VB lost/VBN amid/IN the/DT highly/RB publicized/JJ rebates/NNS being/VBG offered/VBN by/IN Detroit/NP 's/POS Big/JJ Three/CD ./.
But/CC ``/`` on/IN a/DT new/JJ car/NN ,/, a/DT rebate/NN does/VBZ n't/RB work/VB well/RB ''/'' because/IN it/PP cheapens/VBZ the/DT vehicle/NN 's/POS image/NN ,/, contends/VBZ Thomas/NP D./NP Mignanelli/NP ,/, executive/NN vice/NN president/NN of/IN Nissan/NP 's/POS U.S./NP sales/NNS arm/NN ./.
Even/RB if/IN the/DT new/JJ Stanza/NP succeeds/VBZ ,/, Nissan/NP will/MD remain/VB behind/RB in/IN the/DT subcompact/NN segment/NN ,/, where/WRB its/PP$ Sentra/NP does/VBZ n't/RB measure/VB up/RB to/TO the/DT Honda/NP Civic/NP and/CC Toyota/NP Corolla/NP ./.
Nissan/NP will/MD introduce/VB a/DT completely/RB revamped/VBN Sentra/NP next/JJ fall/NN ./.
At/IN the/DT opposite/JJ end/NN of/IN the/DT market/NN ,/, Nissan/NP launches/VBZ its/PP$ luxury/NN Infiniti/NP division/NN on/IN Nov./NP 8/CD --/: three/CD years/NNS after/IN Honda/NN pioneered/VBD Japanese/JJ luxury/NN cars/NNS and/CC two/CD months/NNS after/IN Toyota/NP 's/POS Lexus/NP went/VBD on/IN sale/NN ./.
Nissan/NP started/VBD advertising/VBG Infiniti/NP fully/RB eight/CD months/NNS before/IN the/DT cars/NNS hit/VBD American/JJ showrooms/NNS ./.

When/WRB they/PP found/VBD it/PP last/JJ winter/NN ,/, Dr./NP Vogelstein/NP was/VBD dubious/JJ that/IN the/DT search/NN was/VBD over/RB ./.

The/DT deletion/NN Dr./NP Vogelstein/NP found/VBD was/VBD in/IN exactly/RB the/DT same/JJ spot/NN as/IN p53/NN ./.

Evidence/NN now/RB is/VBZ emerging/VBG that/IN the/DT p53/NN suppressor/NN gene/NN is/VBZ involved/VBN in/IN other/JJ cancers/NNS ,/, too/RB ./.
Researchers/NP in/IN Edinburgh/NP ,/, Scotland/NP ,/, have/VBP found/VBN that/IN in/IN 23/CD of/IN 38/CD breast/NN tumors/NNS ,/, one/CD copy/NN of/IN chromosome/NN 17/CD was/VBD mutated/VBN at/IN the/DT spot/NN where/WRB gene/NN p53/NN lies/NNS ./.

In/IN a/DT report/NN out/IN last/JJ week/NN ,/, John/NP Minna/NP and/CC colleagues/NNS at/IN the/DT National/NP Cancer/NP Institute/NP say/VBP that/IN about/RB half/PDT the/DT cells/NNS taken/VBN from/IN lung/NN cancer/NN tissue/NN they/PP tested/VBD are/VBP missing/VBG this/DT gene/NN ./.

Dr./NP Minna/NP believes/VBZ people/NNS who/WP inherit/VBP a/DT defective/JJ gene/NN somewhere/RB on/IN one/CD of/IN their/PP$ two/CD copies/NNS of/IN chromosome/NN 3/CD are/VBP especially/RB prone/JJ to/TO lung/NN cancer/NN ./.
