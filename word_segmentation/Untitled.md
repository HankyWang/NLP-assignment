#Wearable Devices
-----
The past year has certainly been an exciting time for the semiconductor industry. The shared enthusiasm among silicon companies has been on the rise based on the recent level of interest and demand for new products that complement the mobile experience typically based around smartphones and tablets.

As computers have shrunk from room size to palm size, so they have also moved from being passive accessories, such as laptops and personal digital assistants, to wearable appliances that form an integral part of our personal space. Wearable computers are always on and accessible. As the computer moves from desktop to coat pocket to the human body, its ability to help manage, sort, and filter information will become more intimately connected to our daily lives. 

The problem is that, after seeing a lot of these wearable devices like apple watch or fitbit, many might doubt their ablities to carry and process an amount of information and provide real convenience.According to a survey of IEEE, several key features of the future wearable devices are selected by both designers and ordinary people who use wearable devices throughout their lives.
"light weight","quick response","slient","battery" and "security" are on the top of that list.As for me playing a role as a designer, I would really put my focus on these factors.Taking all these factors into consideration, I bring up an idea of functional clothing.

Traditionally, the concept of functional clothing design addresses the ability of
clothing to assist the bodyâ€™s natural mechanisms to regulate temperature, manage
moisture transport, protect from environmental hazards, and resist impact and
abrasion. These goals have primarily been achieved using passive technologies:
technologies such as performance fabrics, whose properties remain constant in many
environmental conditions and over time. 

1.  Thermal Management    
The human body tightly regulate out temperature around 37 degrees of celtics.
  To manage
the heat produced by the body, functional garment systems of all kinds incorporate
thermal adjustability through layering, venting, and accessories such as cool water or
air pumps. Integration of wearable electronics introduces new challenges for thermal management, by adding the heat produced by certain electronic components to that
produced by the body. 
2. Moisture Management    
Most printed circuit boards are made of completely
impermeable plastics and resins. While these materials are standard to manufacturing
processes and provide the circuitry with necessary support and stability, any
impermeable barrier too close to the body can be uncomfortable. Impermeable barriers
can hold in heat and moisture, thereby reducing comfort and wearability. 
3. Mobility     
Wearable technology design, especially in situations
where resources do not permit custom-design of computing components, often results
in bulky devices mounted onto the body. Adding bulk or volume to the body must be
accomplished in ways that do not interfere with natural movements. Design must also
take into account situation-specific movements required for the accomplishment of a
task
4. Flexibility     
Flexible PCBs are available with optimal
bend radii of 1-2 millimeters. The problem from a wearable perspective is that the
flexibility of a finished board is dependent on the layout of the components it is
populated with. The boards are only flexible outside of the regions populated with
components
5. Sizing and Fit    
If technological devices are designed to be integrated into a garment or
mounted on the body in such a way that the specific location on a given body part is
important to the wearability, comfort, or functionality of the device, individual sizing
and fit can become a significant issue. The anthropometric variation in the human
body across the population is significant, and hard to generalize. The less fit-specific
an insert is the more wearable it can be for a broad range of body types. 

The differences between functional clothing design and current wearable
technology design lie primarily in two areas: variables addressed, and iterative design.
The focus of functional clothing design is on the interaction between the body
covering and the body itself, as well as the physics or mechanics of the function
performed by the protective garment. Only this technology that I come up with is just conceptual,professional skills and newly developed technology are required to help this prototype turn into reality.
